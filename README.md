## What I do?

I'm a software engineer with wide experience in development.

I've had the opportunity to participate in the development of exciting ü§© projects that have helped me to learn ü§î actively. When I develop software my main goal üö©is to solve problems with a clean üßΩ, reusable ‚ôªÔ∏è and scalable ‚¨ÜÔ∏è code. I'm always looking for üîé how to improve myself and how to improve the code and its performance, this is really important üîù in large volume projects.

Adaptability and multidisciplinary teamwork üë•, and seeking always to keep abreast of new trends üÜï in a world üåé of constant change, as is the development of software.

I recently started in the üéì teaching world as a Frameworks teacher at LaSalleBCN (URL University).

On my free time ü•≥ I love to travel ‚úàÔ∏è and learning about science ‚öõ divulgation. 

## Interests

+ üßë‚Äçüî¨ Science Divulgation
+ ü§ñ AI Artificial Intelligence
+ ‚õì Blockchain & Smart Contracts (Specially in Ethereum)
+ ‚úà Travelling

## My philosophy

- `write code for humans and not for machines` is my main principle while I'm developing. 
- `be a team player` because to reach the moon it was not thanks to a single person, but the collaboration between thousands of people.
